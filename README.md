## Overview 

This project achieved a significant milestone in predicting the likelihood of cardiovascular disease by leveraging heart health data such as age, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type. Through meticulous analysis and modeling, the initiative notably enhanced the precision in identifying individuals at high risk for heart-related ailments. This advancement not only underscores the potential of data-driven approaches in healthcare for early detection but also paves the way for more targeted interventions, ultimately contributing to better prevention strategies and health outcomes.

## Data Sources 📊
- The dataset is provided in CSV format for transparency and reproducibility.

## Packages and Libraries 📚
#### Collection of significant Python Libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Cleaning the Data 🧹
#### We begin by thoroughly cleaning our data.
-	Missing values in numerical columns were imputed with the median.
-	Categorical columns with missing values were imputed with the most frequent category.
-	Numerical features were scaled using Standard Scaler to normalize their distributions.
-	Categorical features were one-hot encoded to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models.


## Exploratory Data Analysis 🕵
Initial exploration revealed a mix of numerical and categorical features, with some columns containing missing values.
